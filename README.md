# Telefonica Data Processing Script  
   
## Overview  
   
This script is designed to perform various data processing tasks, including extracting problem columns from CSV files, merging files, summarizing categories, creating search indexes, and running OpenAI-based analysis on documents. The script makes use of several modules and services, such as OpenAI, Azure Data Lake Gen2, and custom classification and search services.  
   
## Prerequisites  
   
Before running this script, ensure you have the following:  
   
1. Python 3.7 or higher  
2. Required Python packages (see below for installation instructions)  
3. `.env` file with the necessary environment variables  
   
## Required Python Packages  
   
You can install the required Python packages using `pip`. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:  
   
```plaintext  
asyncio  
Gen2Services  
searchaiservice  
DocumentAnalysis  
OpenAIKernel  
python-dotenv  
Tools  
classify_questions  
```  
   
Then, run the following command to install the packages:  
   
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  
   
## Environment Variables  
   
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:  
   
```plaintext  
CONNECTION_STRING=<Your Azure Data Lake Gen2 connection string>  
```  
   
## Script Functions  
   
The script contains several functions, each performing a specific task:  
   
- `extract_problems()`: Extracts problem columns from a CSV file.  
- `merge()`: Merges files in the specified directories.  
- `summary_category()`: Summarizes categories.  
- `group_summary()`: Groups summaries.  
- `create_index_manual_solutions()`: Creates a search index for manual solutions.  
- `create_index_manual_roaming_solutions()`: Creates a search index for manual roaming solutions.  
- `testOpenAI()`: Tests the OpenAI service.  
- `insert_manual()`: Inserts manual entries with embeddings into the search index.  
- `insert_roaming_manual()`: Inserts roaming manual entries with embeddings into the search index.  
- `insert_roaming_chunking_manual()`: Inserts chunked roaming manual entries with embeddings into the search index.  
- `insert_documents()`: Inserts documents into the search index.  
- `vector_search()`: Performs a vector search on the manual index.  
- `vector_search_manual()`: Performs a vector search on the manual solutions index.  
- `telefonica_agent()`: Runs the Telefonica semantic agent.  
- `telefonica_ai_agent()`: Runs the Telefonica AI agent.  
- `get_intent()`: Gets the intent of a query using OpenAI.  
- `semantic_ai_agent()`: Runs the semantic AI agent.  
- `use_gen2_services()`: Gets the URL of a file from Azure Data Lake Gen2.  
- `ExtractQA()`: Extracts QA pairs from a document.  
- `ExtractManualProblems()`: Extracts problems from a manual.  
- `ExtractManualRoamingProblems()`: Extracts roaming problems from a manual.  
- `ExtractSolutionManual()`: Extracts solutions from a manual and updates the Data Lake.  
   
## How to Run  
   
To run the script, follow these steps:  
   
1. Ensure you have the required Python packages installed.  
2. Ensure your `.env` file is correctly set up with the necessary environment variables.  
3. Execute the script using Python:  
   
```bash  
python <script_name>.py  
```  
   
Replace `<script_name>` with the actual name of your Python script file.  
   
## Example  
   
Here's an example of how to run the `extract_problems` function:  
   
```python  
import asyncio  
   
# Run the extract_problems function  
asyncio.run(extract_problems())  
```  
   
You can call other functions similarly depending on your needs.  
   
## Notes  
   
- Ensure that the paths to the CSV files and directories are correct.  
- Handle any exceptions
